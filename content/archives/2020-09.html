  title: "Benefits of edge computing in healthcare"
  subtitle: "The widespread adoption of healthcare IoT devices and edge computing will make citizens more aware of their health status. It will also make advanced healthcare resources available in remote areas via telemedicine. The ability for caregivers to regularly keep tabs on their patients will reduce the hospitalization rate significantly. As collaborative edge computing and machine learning are able to preprocess data and generate meaningful analytics in real time, caregivers will spend less time collecting and analysing data and more time caring for their patients."
