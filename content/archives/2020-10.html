  title: "Mono to micro Frontends"
  subtitle: "Building a good frontend for the Website / App is fine, but it would be harder when it has to reach the deadlines with quality and sophistication / features building of the app desired for. One of the root cause for this would be the way, is building the app in a monolithic way. This problem when seen from a different side and by co-relating to the past where a single service architecture bloomed into a micro-service architecture and development kicked with a top-gear. Applying a similar architecture to monolithic frontends and building the apps in micro-frontend way can increase the effectiveness and efficiency of teams working on frontend code with quality, best features and mainly on-time."
