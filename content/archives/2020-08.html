  title: "Is Big Data hyped? Walk-through Spark, Kafka and Google BigQuery"
  subtitle: "'Big Data' hype was at its peak during the year 2012 then fallen gradually. Nowadays our minds got stabilized about the real necessity of tools like Hadoop. Meantime \"Cloud computing and Event\" streaming also emerged rapidly as steroids, re-inventing the SQL architecture available in cloud for fulfilling the Big Data needs of an app. In this event, let us discuss why these tools can be used in an app and where to be placed in a data architecture (Event streaming - Kafka, Analytics engine - Spark, Cloud data warehouse - Google BigQuery)."
